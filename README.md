## Privacy Impact Assessment 
#### Description
The particular work deals with the issue of privacy from the point of view of its evaluation. More specifically, the concept of privacy is analyzed, as well as an assessment of the impact that may be caused if it is not protected under certain circumstances. Non-privacy protection is not necessarily due to malicious actions from the external environment of a system, but can also be caused by structural failures in the information system or design errors.
